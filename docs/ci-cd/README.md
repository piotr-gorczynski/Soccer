This directory documents issues and solutions encountered during the automation of Google Cloud CI/CD pipelines with Firebase.

## 1. Firebase Authentication Initialization

**Problem**: Attempts to enable Email/Password sign-in via API resulted in a `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` error.

**Root Cause**: Firebase Authentication must first be initialized by a manual "Get Started" action in the Firebase Console.

**Solution**: Automate this initialization using Terraform's `google_identity_platform_project_default_config`.

## 2. Cloud Build IAM Permission Error

**Problem**: Cloud Build failed to enable the Identity Platform API due to a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error, even with broad roles like `owner`.

**Root Cause**: Missing or blocked `servicemanagement.services.bind` permission due to higher-level organizational policies or IAM scope issues.

**Solution**: Investigate org policies and ensure `roles/servicemanagement.admin` and `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` are properly granted to Cloud Build SA.
