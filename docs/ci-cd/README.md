## Firebase Auth `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` â€“ Programmatic Fix

**Problem**: Attempts to enable Email/Password sign-in using the Identity Toolkit Admin API resulted in a `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` error.

**Root Cause**: Firebase Authentication must first be initialized for the project â€” this usually happens manually in the Firebase Console by clicking "Get Started", but is missing in CI/CD pipelines.

**Solution**: Automate initialization using one of two approaches:

- **Option A**: Add Firebase to the project using `firebase projects:addfirebase` or REST.
- **Option B**: Use the Identity Platform `initializeAuth` endpoint to directly create the auth configuration.

The attached guide includes:
- Required IAM permissions
- Required APIs
- Example `curl` and `gcloud` commands
- CI/CD tips and pitfalls
- How to enable email/password after initialization
