    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 2023-12-01</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This policy describes how the Soccer mobile application (the "Service") collects and uses information. The app displays advertising using Google AdMob and offers sign-in via Firebase Authentication (email, Gmail, Facebook and other providers).</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you create an account or sign in, we collect your email address and a nickname. If you choose to sign in with Gmail, Facebook or another provider, we may receive basic profile information such as your name and profile picture from that provider.</p>
    <p>We store your game statistics, tournament participation and presence status (online/offline) in Firebase Firestore and Realtime Database. The app also saves a Firebase Cloud Messaging token on your device and in Firestore to deliver push notifications.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to create and manage your account, show leaderboards, enable multiplayer matches and send you notifications. Your data also helps us detect abuse and keep the Service secure.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The app uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect device information (such as your advertising ID) to serve and personalize ads in accordance with their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We rely on Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Realtime Database and Cloud Messaging) provided by Google LLC. Authentication providers (e.g. Google or Facebook) may process your data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We only share data with the services listed above to operate the application.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You may update or delete your account information by contacting us. You can opt out of personalized ads through your device settings.</p>
